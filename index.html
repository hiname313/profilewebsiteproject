        <p>My name is Vedant Shah I have many hobbies. One of them is to code. The first coding language 
        I learnt was python, then I learnt HTML and CSS. After that, I learnt how to code on swift, which is a mac coding language 
    that lets you devolop ios apps. My first ever app was a screen time app. You would have to answer questions and it would give you 
your recomended screen time. One of my other hobbies is learning stock investing with my dad. He taught me about multiple terms such 
as P/E ratio and Earnings Per Share. He also taught me how the stock market works. My final hobby is to play cricket. I go to shivaji Park in 
Mumbai and play cricket with 19 year old bois. I enjoy cricket. </p>

        <p>I would call myself a sporty person because I enjoy playing many sports. Two of my favourite sports are football and cricket.
        I play cricket at a much more serious level than football. With football I just like going down to the garden and playing with anyone.
        But I play serious cricket in a place called Mahul that is next to Chembur in Mumbai. I play with older people and I enjoy the challenges 
        that cricket comes with. I play a little bit of football at schools for about 4-5 hours every week. My two favourite football teams are Liverpool
        and Manchester city. I support India in international cricket and Mumbai Indians in the IPL. My 5 favourite footballers are Mohammed Salah 
        Phil Foden  Kylian Mbappe and Erling Halaand and Messi. My top 5 favourite cricketers and Brian Lara, Virat Kohli, Sachin Tendulkar, Rohit Sharma
        and Chetaswar Pujara.

<p>My favourite planes is the gulfstream g650 also known as the rolls royce of planes. I like it because of its design and long 
    distance. My favourite commercial jet is none other than the queen of the skies, the boeing 747-800. This giant runs on 4 engines
and has a maximum of 530 knots. It also has a range of around 13,000 km. It can also hold about 350,000 kg. I love these planes because of their 
history and their features. I enjoy planes because of the way they fly. I find it a miracle how it stays in the air for so long. </p>
